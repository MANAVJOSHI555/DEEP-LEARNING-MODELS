## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included

âœ… **Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)**  
A feedforward Artificial Neural Network trained on customer demographics and behavior features to predict churn likelihood, optimized with early stopping and regularization.

âœ… **GRE Score Prediction (ANN)**  
A regression-focused ANN to estimate GRE scores based on student profiles, trained on Mean Squared Error loss with tuned hyperparameters for high RÂ² accuracy.

âœ… **Cat vs Dog Image Classifier (CNN)**  
A Convolutional Neural Network trained on the classic cat/dog dataset, using data augmentation, max-pooling, and dropout to improve generalization.
